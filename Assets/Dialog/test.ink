Shelly: Uncle Jay, why is the water green?
Jay: Stay out from that water! It's dangerous!
Jay: Hello, can I help you?
Sam (Me): I've just moved here to research these waters
Jay: Oh, I see. Pleasure to meet you, Sam. So, you're part of that fancy ocean research place huh?
Sam (Me): *nods*
Jay: Well, I can tell you right now what the problem is, miss, its all the garbage! You can't take five steps in without brushing into some plastic junk! It's just horrible!
Shelly: Can I play in the water pleeeeeeeease?!?
Jay: No, Shelly, not today. I've got a meeting to get to, and your grandpa is busy at work.
Shelly: Awwwwwwwww
Jay: Say, if you really want to help this place, bring this ocean back to life by cleaning it up a bit
Jay: Anyway, We really must be going, but it was nice meeting you. See you around!
Shelly: Bye Bye!
You stand there, thinking about the little girl wanting to swim
You decide to clean up this nasty ocean!
